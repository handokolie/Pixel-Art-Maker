# Pixel-Art-Maker
## Udacity's Pixel Art Maker Project
This project is part of the Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree where students are required to build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.

How to run the app:
1. Input Grid Height and Grid Width with a minimum value of 1 and a maximum value of 50 respectively.
2. Click the Submit button and an empty grid will appear on the page.
3. You can begin clicking each cell in the grid, the colour can be changed by choosing a colour from the Pick A Colour button.
4. Clicking a cell will replace the previous existing colour with a newly chosen colour (and only that cell will change colour).
5. Click Submit button to refresh all the colours.
